# Exercise 4

The aim of the exercise is to apply transfer learning to train a CNN on the same dataset as the exercise-3.
As the input dataset don't have a lot of samples, it's a very good example to apply transfer-learning.


## Instructions

### Step 1
Train a CNN based on one pre-trained model from the [following list](https://keras.io/api/applications/#available-models) 

!!! warning

    You must be able to reach a very good accuracy, above 90%

Evaluate your model :

* Plot accuracy and loss curves
* Confusion matrix
* Print metrics such as accuracy, f1-score etc... on test set

### Step 2

Repeat the step 1 with another model, compare and choose the best model
